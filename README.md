# Gaffer_ProjectMonitor_Python_GUI_Databse

This is my 5th Semester Academic Project. This project is coded using Python core with Tkinter GUI.

Gaffer is a GUI based desktop application that helps to solve the problems that are present in the traditional team and project management area.
It is designed to focus on the corporate world that helps the team lead in managing the projects, members, clients. 
The main objective of this project is to replace the traditional paperwork with a digital record of information, visual representation of the information through charts for more robust understanding and distinction. It provides a separate view for both Team lead and Team members. 

This project supports "Work From Home" as team members do not need to rush to the office to update their progress and is useful during the Pandemic situation like COVID-19.

Technology Used: Python GUI (Frontend), SQLite3 (Backend), Matplotlib library
